# Tailwind CSS template for Joomla!

Start using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to create fast prototypes for Joomla!  

## Quick start.

This template comes a [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) build system using [joomla-gulp](https://github.com/phproberto/joomla-gulp). Edit Sass, javascript files and CSS & JS files will be updated for you.

1. Clone this repository and install the template through Joomla using Extensions > Manage > Install pointing to the folder containing your clone.
2. Duplicate `gulp-config.dist.json` to `gulp-config.json` and update its values to point to the folder and host of the joomla site you are creating the template for.
3. Execute `npm install` inside your clone folder
4. Execute `gulp` to start Gulp. A browser window should be launched and Gulp will start to watch any changed file to update the template files in the joomla-site.

Check [joomla-gulp documentation](https://github.com/phproberto/joomla-gulp/blob/master/docs/README.md) for extended details.
